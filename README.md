# My Working Projects

#BasicModel.py 

This File Consists of Model Which predicts the credit defaulters using logistic, Decision and Randomforest to differentiate one is better then another and evaluated the model with metrics.

#Retail_Base_Model.py

This Model will predict the product type using image of the retail stores. The model is created with CNN, MaxPooling and MLP.

#MarketBasket.py

In this file, I have used the Apriori Algorithms for the Recommendation problems. 

#CustomerSegmentation.py

In this File, I have used K means which is one of clustering Algorithms using customer DataSets.
